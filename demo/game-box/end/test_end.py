"""The end of the night: a photo of the GM's handwritten page read into the
binder by the ocr add-on, the night compiled and closed by gm-end.md, and
what the table holds true printed last. The page is made up: a fifth
night's notes in a handwriting-like font, tilted and grainy like a phone
photo.

ocr is a deps add-on: it reads only where tesseract is on PATH and its own
requirements (Pillow, pypdf) import, as in the deps job's environment, not
in every job that runs this. Where it can, the page is held to what it
says; where it can't, the night is held to what a GM without it gets: the
ocr step flagged, the other nine run, and no page that was never read in
the threads or the recap. Both are asserted; neither is skipped."""
