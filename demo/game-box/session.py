"""session.py: a session at the table played by code, as far as it goes without the person. Python 3.9+.

    python demo/game-box/session.py --table DIR [--world NAME] [--now TS]
    python demo/game-box/session.py --table DIR [--world NAME] offer CHARACTER "FACT" [--as KIND]
    python demo/game-box/session.py --table DIR canon
    python demo/game-box/session.py --table DIR recap
    python demo/game-box/session.py --table DIR export-canon [--to FILE]

The game master's bookkeeping, done by code: every action beat is rolled for
the character whose turn it is, leaning into the approach the beat suggests,
and every decision is handed in for the seal. Then it stops. Only whoever
holds the key moves a decision, with the kernel's own `seal` or `decline`;
run this again after and it settles their answer and plays on to the next.
A story played to its end prints what the table made true: each ruling,
sealed or declined, and the line each roll gave.

A roll can turn the story: a beat with a `when` is played only if the beat
it names came out its way, so a missed riddle leads somewhere a solved one
doesn't. The rulings put to the person are the ones the story reached.

`offer` is a player bringing something to the table on the night, as their
character: "a guest walks in". It is handed in for the seal, and the story
goes on while it waits. Once the GM seals or declines it, the next run
writes their answer down before it plays on, and a sealed offer is canon.

`canon` is the table's memory: every ruling sealed on this record whose seal
still holds, in the order they were sealed, and every one declined. It reads
only seals, never the worlds, so what it says is what the person made true.

`recap` is "previously on...", for the start of the next session. Its first
part is to read aloud: only what the table made true, the sealed canon,
last session's first (a session ends where its session seal says), so
nothing the table hasn't heard is said. Its second part is for the GM's
eyes: the notes of the latest night, typed or scanned, each line cited, the
promises made for next time, and what was said no to.

`export-canon` is the play growing the world: every fact the GM sealed,
as markdown, each with its seal (the proposal's hash and row) and where in
play it came from, for story-timeline's `import-canon` to put on the
writer's timeline. Only what was sealed goes; a declined ruling stays here.

NAME is a world in DIR/worlds (lantern-fair unless said). The story is
opened if it isn't yet. This never seals, declines or reads the key, and
writes only through game-master, which writes through dice and the kernel.

Exit codes, the kernel's: 0 the story is played to its end; 42 a decision
waits on the seal; 2 refused.
