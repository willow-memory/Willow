"""ideas.py: story ideas between sessions, made from what's in the box. Python 3.9+.

    python demo/game-box/ideas.py --table DIR [--seed TEXT] [--count N]

For the GM's eyes, between sessions. Nothing here is canon and nothing is
handed in: an idea the GM likes, they write in their binder or into a story.

Four parts, all from the box itself:

- **Seeds.** A grammar built from the box's own words: the characters and
  places of its stories, the monsters and people of the binder, the threads
  promised for next time, and what the table made true. The oracle-text
  add-on deals readings from it with willow's seeded stream, so a seed (the
  day, unless given) and a number always deal the same idea again.
- **Set up, never played.** A monster or person with a page in the binder
  whose name no session's notes, typed or scanned, has said yet.
- **Still open.** Every promise made for next time.
- **Something you wrote and forgot.** One passage of the binder drawn by the
  surprise add-on, replayable from its seed (a `surprise` row on the record).

Exit codes, the kernel's: 0 done; 2 refused.
